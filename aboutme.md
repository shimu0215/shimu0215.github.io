JAVA and NLP develop engineer intern Aug. 2020-Feb. 2021

I was responsible for the development of medical literature analysis function and NLP
model training and deploying. Worked using an Agile development and DevOps
approach.
- Developed an online document annotation platform(JAVA, Spring Boot, RESTful API,
HSQLDB), deployed and maintained it on our server(Linux, Docker, Git). Optimized the
display strategy, increased the loading speed to the available level(JavaScript).
- Implemented a data processing pipeline(JAVA, Shell, RESTful API). Designed our own
data format to structure literature. Wrote instructions and design documents.
- Implemented an online file system for our data set, incorporated Hirschberg algorithm to
it to realize sequence matching between articles(JAVA). This algorithm improved
processing speed greatly since it is constant in both time and space complexity.
- Improved the general accuracy of a literature analysis NLP model(CRF++) from70% to
97% when working in English literature. Improved its general accuracy from 30% to 90%
when working in another language literature.
