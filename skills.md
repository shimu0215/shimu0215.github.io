## Overview
I have work experience as an NLP engineer. In this job, we expect to use AI to assist the science industry. Through this job, I have the ability to write standardized, efficient, and readable code, as well as quickly read open source code and debug, modify, or optimize it. I have also learned to quickly learn new skills and tools.

I have project experience in GNN, RL and robotics during my graduate study. And in my undergraduate study, I spent the most time on projects related to embedded systems and hardware design, and robotics. This summer, I am helping my professor with his work about GNN and GeoAI.

In the senior year of my undergraduate study, I helped my professor guide other students' senior designs, so if needed, I believe I am able to understand and participate in other people's projects well.
