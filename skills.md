## Overview
I have participated in the application of AI in the science industry as an NLP engineer and have good practical and collaborative abilities. I have mature software development skills and can write standardized, efficient, and readable code. I can also quickly read other people's code and debug or modify it.

I have project experience in graph neural network, reinforcement learning and robotics. This summer, I am helping professor with his work about GeoAI. I am very interested in all research directions related to deep learning and robotics.

In the senior year of my undergraduate study, I helped my professor guide other students' senior designs, and if needed, I am able to understand and participate in other people's projects well.
