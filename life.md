#### Art

Obtained my second major in Architecture and enjoy various ancient or modern architecture. 
Love art history, admire Kandinsky and Edgar the most, also visit contemporary art exhibition. If there is any opportunity to participate in a Generative Art project, I am very looking forward to it.

Was a drumer in a rock band. Pink Floyd and King Crimson are my favorite bands, also like a Chinese band, Omnipotent Youth Society, very much!
