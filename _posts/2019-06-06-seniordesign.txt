- Outstanding senior design of 2019 class, included in the library as a representative of EE major 2019
- Demonstration defense of the School of Information

This project designs a wheeled robot platform that includes multiple functions. The work mainly includes circuit design, circuit fabrication, control algorithm programming, and simple mechanical structure design

Specifically, the following tasks were completed:
- Complete the control circuit, use ARM chip as MCU, and make circuits for driving motors, receiving sensor signals, and connecting the Wi-Fi antenna and other parts of the robot.
- Ccomplete a wireless charging device based on Farad capacitors, which can achieve fast charging and automatically start when the charging is completed during shutdown. Farad capacitors charge faster and more environmentally friendly than traditional energy storage devices.
- Implemented the code to design effective and safe action routes for robots based on sensor signals, running targets, and instructions issued by users through Wi-Fi, also ensure correct route execution through PID.
- Enable robots to move flexibly through the McNamm wheel.
