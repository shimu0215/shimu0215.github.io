This project is a method of robot trajectory planning. The problem will be formulated as a convex optimization problem. The main purpose of the method is to get a shortest path from point to point which avoid all obstacles. The method will use the objective function to limit the length of the path. And the obstacles will be represent as constrains in the optimization problem.

Since the terrain in the real world in highly non-convex, one important work of this method is to make the constrains of the function convex. Then the problem could be solved in the way for solving convex optimization problems.

### Method

#### Objective function

An eligible path for motion planning should avoid obstacles, meet all constrains from requirements from robots functions and mechanical constrain. And it should be as short as possible.

We express the result trajectory as a sequence of point. The connection between these points is the whole trajectory. 
We first initialize a reference path, which link the start point and the end point with a straight line. We will update the reference path to make it avoid obstacles.

Since the reference is the shortest way to the target position, we want the new trajectory be close to the reference trajectory. 
But the result trajectory might go around a long way to make itself be closed to the reference trajectory without a part of the objective function to limit the length of the trajectory itself.

Therefore the objective function is composed by two parts,

where x is the decision variable, a and b are positive parameters.

#### Constrain Functions

Since the feasible set for x is not convex, we try to extract n convex set from it. 
(n is the number of positions in the trajectory) 
Then get x from each convex set.

In practical implementation, we approximate obstacles to some circles, which is also a Convex optimization problem. We minimize the area approximated to obstacles under the constrain of ensuring that obstacles are fully included.
