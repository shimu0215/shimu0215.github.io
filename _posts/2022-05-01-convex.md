### Overview

This project is a method of robot trajectory planning. The problem will be formulated as a convex optimization problem. The main purpose of the method is to get a shortest path from point to point which avoid all obstacles. The method will use the objective function to limit the length of the path. And the obstacles will be represent as constrains in the optimization problem.

Since the terrain in the real world in highly non-convex, one important work of this method is to make the constrains of the function convex. Then the problem could be solved in the way for solving convex optimization problems.
